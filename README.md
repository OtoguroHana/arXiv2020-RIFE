# RIFE
## Abstract
We propose a real-time intermediate flow estimation algorithm (RIFE) for video frame interpolation (VFI). Most existing methods first estimate the bi-directional optical flows, and then linearly combine them to approximate intermediate flows, leading to artifacts around motion boundaries. We design an intermediate flow model named IFNet that can directly estimate the intermediate flows from coarse to fine. We then warp the input frames according to the estimated intermediate flows and employ a fusion process to compute final results. Based on our proposed leakage distillation, RIFE can be trained end-to-end and achieve excellent performance. Experiments demonstrate that RIFE is significantly faster than existing flow-based VFI methods and achieves state-of-the-art index on several benchmarks.

WIP. We are working on releasing our code.
